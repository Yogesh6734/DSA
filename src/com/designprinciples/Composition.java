//
//Definition: Composition is a "has-a" relationship with strong ownership.
//The contained object (part) cannot exist independently of the container (whole).
// If the container object is destroyed, the contained objects are also destroyed.
//
//        Real-World Example:
//A car has engines. If the car is destroyed, the engine is also destroyed.
//        Analogy:
//A house has rooms. If the house is torn down, the rooms donâ€™t exist independently.




// Car and Engine have a composition relationship.
