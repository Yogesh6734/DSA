//Definition: Association represents a relationship between two objects,
// where one object uses or interacts with another. It does not imply ownership,
// and the lifecycle of the objects is independent of each other.
//        Real-World Example:
//A teacher teaches students. The teacher and student objects are linked,
// but neither owns the other.
//        Analogy:
//Think of a bus driver and a bus. The bus driver drives the bus,
// but the driver doesnâ€™t own the bus.

    }
